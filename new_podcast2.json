Why was the system created? And who benefits from school choice? We'll answer all of these questions and more on this edition of Getting Schooled. I'm Abbey Hornaceck. School is officially back in session. And if I go back all the years ago to when I went to school, the main choices I had when I went to Target was which lunchbox am I going to pick out? What backpack am I going to cover my books with paper bags or those stretchy ones that you get from one of the aisles in Target? So for a kid, it might not seem that crazy going back to school. But for parents, they have an important decision to make, and that is which school am I going to send my child? So for a long time, if you decide to send your child to a public school, it had to do with your area code. So not only are you buying a home, you're also picking out a home that will be in a district where you want to send your kid to school. Well, that's where school choice comes in. School choice allows families the opportunity to choose what school or learning environment they want to send kids to that might better cater to that kid's needs. So what are the arguments for and against school choice? How would vouchers work? And how would it impact the educational system as a whole? Well, joining me in the classroom for today's lesson on school choice is the director of Cato's Center for Educational Freedom, Neil McCluskey. And Neil was kind enough to join me now. How's it going, Neil? It's going all right. How are you? I am better now that you are here with me to talk about school choice. Because this is this is obviously a topic that comes up a lot, and especially in today's world, education is key. After covid, people are talking about, you know, just learning and getting back into the schools. So people really care because our kids are our future. I went to school, you, I assume, went to school, and it's it's an interesting topic for people across the board. So I just want to start by asking you if you could just explain what is going on right now with the education system, how is it designed and where does school choice come in? All right. Well, so I mean, the norm in education in the United States has been, you know, maybe for the last one hundred and twenty years or so that you get assigned to a public school based on your home address. So where you live. So most people are probably accustomed to, you know, they're they're in a house or they're in an apartment and they're told you're going to go to public school number four or maybe that school has a name and you're going with people who have also been assigned to that school based on where they live. And it's usually part of a school district, which usually contains maybe a few elementary schools, a middle school or two and a high school. And you just kind of get funneled through that. And there wasn't a lot of expectation that your parents would choose something other than that. You just went to the to the government run school that you were told to go to. And that was, again, it's been the norm for maybe a hundred years or so. Public schooling is older than that. But for a long time, people weren't going to school that much. There wasn't a lot of going to high school. But as that became the model, what we saw more and more was people saying, oh, wait a minute, that school doesn't work for me. Sometimes it was because of academics. The school just didn't teach math and reading well. More often it was because of personal things. For a long time, public schools in the United States were kind of de facto Protestant institutions, although kind of a lowest common denominator Protestantism. So you saw a lot of Catholics say, well, that doesn't work for us. And that's why you have a whole lot of Catholic schools in the country. And then people said, but I'm an atheist and that doesn't work for me. And then in the 60s, we got rid of all religion and lots of people said, but I need religion in my school. So we saw this big increase in Christian schools and Jewish day schools. And people wanted to choose something else. But the problem was they still had to pay a whole bunch of taxes for those public schools to which you were assigned just based on where you lived. And so we've seen this growing movement to say, hey, instead of that tax money going to a particular school, to a government school, let it follow my kids to the school I choose. And that's kind of where we are now when we talk about school choice. I mean, that makes sense because, you know, you're you're putting your kids into school, you're paying taxes, you want them to have the best education as possible. And I'm curious to ask you this. Why why do you think it has changed? Obviously, it's been a discussion to be able to send your kids where you wanted to send them. But I feel like and correct me if I'm wrong, in the last couple of years, it's become more to the forefront. Do you think it has to do with, in part, housing prices? Us millennials love to complain how hard it is to buy a house. And if I have when I have kids, I would love to be able to send them where I want to send them. But I don't know what I'll be able to afford in terms of houses. So do you think that plays a role in it? Yeah, there are a lot of things driving a really big move for school choice now. I think it's important to understand that people were asking for school choice really from the first days of public schooling, the earliest time when we were starting to see public schooling going back to the 19th century. So this isn't new. But the the effort to get it has been very strong in the last few years. I think part of that is, yes, people used to choose a school, a public school, by choosing a home. In other words, if you wanted to access a particular school, the way you paid tuition was you bought a house. But that's a really expensive way to pay for a school. And lots of people, I think, have seen that, wow, buying a house just to get a school, that's an extremely expensive proposition. Many people simply can't buy the home in a district that they want to go to. And so that's been a part of it. The other thing we've been seeing is that after COVID or during COVID, when people were getting education or kids were getting education in the home, usually online, that a lot of parents started to see that they don't like the things that the schools are teaching. And that has driven a desire for a lot more choice to choose schools that teach things that are consistent with the values and the beliefs of the family. And, of course, when everybody was sort of forced to online learning because they were forbidden from going to that physical school, they also got kind of aggravated saying, I want more power. I don't want to just be told, hey, I can't put my kids in school because the government has said, Nope, these schools are closed. Yeah. I mean, you look at some of the books that they're bringing into these schools and you're like, wow, even at 29 years old, I would not be reading that type of literature. And yeah, it is parents want more and more control because of, to your point, what's being taught in these schools. And that is an element that I think is driving people to go and say, I want to make the decision on my own. What do you what what what does school choice look like then in these states that have passed it? And what states have gotten involved? Well, so school choice has really exploded a lot even since the 1990s. I should probably lay out a little bit of what we mean by that. So the idea of school choice is basically money follows the kids instead of going directly to a government school. But there are a lot of different kind of flavors of school choice. Many people have probably heard of charter schools and charter schools are like a public private hybrid that are that are technically public. But they're usually schools that are free of a lot of rules and regulations that govern traditional public schools and money. Some amount of money, public money, follows children to those charter schools and they they choose them. Families choose them. So that's one form of school choice. But they are public schools. They typically can't be religious, although that is now being challenged in the state of Oklahoma. But anywhere else, they can't be religious. And they have to do things like give state tests, which means they have to follow state standards, which really constrains how much choice they can be. The much bigger explosion in school choice that we've seen is choice where money follows kids to private schools or increasingly to lots of options, not just private schools, but if you need tutoring or if you're homeschooling, you want to buy curriculum. So vouchers is typically the term we use for, hey, the government will let you take some amount of money that would have gone to a public school to pay for private school tuition. And it's usually just tuition. We've had tax credit programs where if you send your child to a private school, you can get a tax credit for the cost of that school. Or more powerfully, if you donate to a group that provides scholarships to private schools, individuals could donate, corporations can donate, then they get tax credits. So that's like a voucher. But the funders have a lot of choice. That is another form of school choice that's been widespread. But it's again just for private school tuition. And now we have these education savings accounts where you get money put into an account that you can use for a private school. But again, you can also use it for other things like tutoring or buying curricula. And what we've seen is we've gone to now universal ESA programs. I think it's in seven or eight states now, just in the last year. So West Virginia kind of started it a couple of years ago. Arizona, which has long been a leader in school choice, moved to universal ESAs in the middle of 2022. And then we've seen states like Iowa and Oklahoma and others in Florida and others move to this universal school choice, often universal ESA model. All right, we've got to step aside for a quick recess, but we'll be back right after this.

So you're saying that if, let's say I'm going to send my kid to a private school, but I live in a district where there is a public school, instead of some of my taxpayer dollars going to that public school, I can take that money and apply it to the tuition that my child has in my private school. And that's a voucher. Is that what you're saying? Yes. So typically it's, you know, the way we fund education is depending on your state, but about 45 percent of it is money that's from the local government, usually through property taxes. About 45 percent is from the state, usually from income taxes or other taxes. And around 10 percent is from the federal government. And usually it's that state part that could follow a child to whatever private school they want. So the local district usually doesn't have their money taken. But the state says, look, you shouldn't be constrained to a school district. If you want to go to a private school, you can take much of your state money to that. And so that's usually how it works, although it varies a little bit from state to state. You know, it's interesting because not too often do we get to decide where our taxpayer dollars go to. So it's nice that at least you can kind of make that decision and say, hey, I'm going to go here and I can take some of that money with me that I'm already paying to the government. So what would happen then to the schools in those districts, like the public schools, if let's say a bunch of the parents say we don't want to send our kids here. The education is not what we want for our children. We're going to send them to private. What would then happen to the funding for those public schools? Well, so what you see is especially, you know, so those kids were in public schools and they go to a private school. So the first thing is there's actually more money per student left in that public school because remember, it's typically only the state money. So the local money that would have been funding a kid who moved, it stays in that public school. So you see more money for kids who stay in that public school. We also see that there's a lot of research. It's like 26 or 27 studies now, almost all of which show that when that public school faces competition, that public school does better. So what we see in that public school is actually more money per student and better outcomes. Now, what could happen, but we haven't seen it, is that school choice is so popular or there are other options that are so much more popular of the public school that almost everybody leaves. We haven't seen that. But what that would say clearly is, hey, we need something other than that public school because it's not providing what the vast majority of people want. And what school choice would typically result in then is other people starting private schools like the ones that are so popular and kids wouldn't be left without options. They would all choose something else. But again, that's not what we see. What we typically see is there are some families who say, I want something else. I need something else. And they choose it. But it's never so many that a public school just goes out of business. What they typically do is face competition, which is better for everyone. Yeah, you've seen our math and science scores in this country are just they're dismal compared to other countries. So if there is competition, then that's good because we're kind of encouraging. I was an athlete. So, you know, if you're if you're playing a better team, it encourages you to to be better. And if you're going to be left without another option, it kind of forces you to step up your own game. So maybe maybe that's maybe that is a good thing. Do do school vouchers work for homeschooling as well? I'm just wondering about this because so many people are discussing pulling their kids out of school, teaching them themselves. They are fed up with the things that they're they're being taught and they want to instill their own values into their kids. Can you apply that to your education at home? So usually a voucher doesn't apply to education at home because it has to be taken to a private school. So an actual school. But education savings accounts do apply to homeschoolers. Now, it's important how you write those laws. And the policy analyst who works at Cato's Center for Educational Freedom, which I direct, Colleen Hrancek, just released a paper talking about how to write laws so that ESAs can help homeschoolers. But homeschoolers are often somewhat concerned that if any government money or government connected money is involved in homeschooling, that you'll get government rules and regulations and that the homeschoolers lose freedom. And there is reason to be concerned about that. I mean, often government money does bring government strings. So there's sort of a divide among homeschoolers. And there are ways you can write laws that say, look, if you take this money as a homeschooler, you'll be designated somewhat differently than other homeschoolers who don't take the money. But it does give you the ability to educate at home, but basically not have to pay twice for education, once in taxes and then the second time for all the costs of buying curriculum and textbooks or other things that you use for homeschooling. So education savings accounts can help homeschoolers or applicable to homeschoolers. But it's also important that some homeschoolers who don't want the connection can still be legally separate. Right. T"}, "podcast_summary": "In this podcast episode, the host discusses the concept of school choice and its implications in the education system. School choice refers to the ability of families to choose the school or learning environment that best suits their child's needs, rather than being limited to the public school assigned to them based on their home address.\n\nThe traditional model of education in the United States has been that children are assigned to a public school based on their home address. However, over time, people have realized that this model may not work for everyone, leading to a growing demand for more educational options. This demand has been driven by various factors, including dissatisfaction with the quality of education in certain public schools, religious or cultural preferences, and the desire for more control over what is taught in schools.\n\nThe podcast discusses the different forms of school choice, such as charter schools, vouchers, tax credits, and education savings accounts (ESAs). Charter schools are publicly funded schools that operate with more flexibility and autonomy than traditional public schools. Vouchers allow families to use government funds to pay for private school tuition, while tax credits provide incentives for individuals or corporations to donate to scholarship funds that can be used for private school tuition. ESAs are accounts that parents can use to pay for a variety of educational expenses, including private school tuition, tutoring, and curriculum materials.\n\nThe podcast also addresses the impact of school choice on public schools. When students choose to attend a private school or use an ESA, the funding that would have gone to the public school they would have attended is redirected. This can result in more funding per student for public schools that remain, as well as increased competition that can lead to improved outcomes.\n\nThe host and guest emphasize that school choice is not intended to eliminate public schools or leave them without students. Instead, it aims to provide families with more options and encourage healthy competition among educational institutions. Additionally, they discuss the potential inclusion of homeschooling in school choice programs through ESAs, but note the concerns some homeschoolers have about government involvement and regulations.\n\nOverall, the podcast highlights the growing demand for school choice in the United States and explores the different forms it can take, as well as its potential impact on the education system.", "podcast_guest": "Neil McCluskey", "podcast_guest_org": "Cato Institute", "podcast_guest_title": null, "podcast_guest_info": "Not Available", "podcast_guest_url": null, "podcast_highlights": "\"School choice allows families the opportunity to choose what school or learning environment they want to send kids to that might better cater to that kid's needs.\" - Abbey Hornaceck, Getting Schooled podcast.", "podcast_hashtags": ["school", "choice", "education", "system", "voucher", "public", "schools", "homeschooling"]}
