Well, it was very much influenced by the legend of the Sandman. Now, in the development process, initially it was much more a dream creature. It was much more sort of Freddy Krueger, where it would take on these nightmarish images, and everyone encountering with the Sandman would sort of be tailored to their own individual dreams. And as that script progressed, I said to myself, I've seen this before. This is nothing new. We've done this. And so, about halfway through, I kind of went back and re-conceived what our approach to the Sandman was to make it much more personal for one specific character. Yeah. That is Peter Sullivan kicking off my month of horror podcast here on Sci-Fi Talk with the Sandman. Not to be confused with Neil Gaiman's fantasy. This Sandman is attached to one particular person, in this case a small girl that comes from her nightmares. And this is Sci-Fi Talk, the podcast on how sci-fi, fantasy, horror, and comics help us explore our humanity. Here's more with Peter Sullivan. And what was it like to kind of come up, essentially, to what he looks like in that process? Very interesting. When we started, it was going to be much bulkier. I think some of the powers that we saw, the name Sandman, and we're thinking much more in terms of a rock creature. So, if you imagine something like the Thing from the Fantastic Four, or one of the rock creatures in the Power Rangers, or something like that, or big and bulky and a lot more sediment and that sort of thing. And we did a couple designs with that, and we realized that that was not going to be effective, both from a production standpoint and also from a scare standpoint. You have this lumbering thing coming after you, it's just kind of silly. So, we went sleeker. It took a lot of the same design elements, but turned it into a much more aerodynamic figure. And I worked very closely with wonderful creature designers and creators, George Truster and Sid Newton, and created this iteration. My conversation about The Sandman, part horror film, urban legend, and fantasy, on Sci-Fi Talk, continues in a moment. Good cast, I mean a horror stalwart in Tobin Bell. Is there a chance he's playing a good guy in this for a change? You know, I don't want to give away any plot twists, but one of the things that, you know, always keep in mind when I'm doing a film like this, is that the audience has seen the same film that I have. They've read the same books that I have. They have the same cultural influences. So, I can play with expectations because I know, oh, Tobin Bell is going to be in this movie. Well, clearly he's going to be this, you know, horrific villain. And I can play with that. And that's about as much as I want to give away until you get the chance to see the movie. You know, what's intriguing to me is the mother and daughter relationship in this. Haley Duff playing the mom, and young Shay Smolik, who, from what I've seen, you know, really brings it to the screen. Kind of talking about that aspect of the film. When we decided that we wanted to keep this creature specific to the character of Madison, what Shay played, I realized that we needed to have the heart, that this was very important. And originally the character that Haley plays was very different. And I thought, well, okay, well, that's, you know, the dynamic is there, but you know what? It's not much of a journey for her. And so it came out of, you know, a dramatic desire to create an interesting arc from a character who absolutely is not ready to be a mother, shouldn't be a mother, shouldn't even go near your kid. And then, you know, throughout the course of the movie becomes a strong mother figure. And we had worked with Haley before. I'd done a Christmas movie with her a number of years ago. Absolutely fantastic actress. Loved working with her. You know, she's now a mother herself. I knew that she would bring that dynamic because I felt with Tobin and Amanda, you know, we had the horror world taken care of. I needed somebody to take care of the humanity. Now, as far as the Sandman himself, I don't want you to give away any secrets, but did you kind of mix up like prosthetics and also CGI a little bit? Yeah, no, that was a great testament to, again, George and Sig. I can't think of enough great things about these guys. And they're just so wonderful. Originally it was going to be much more CGI. It was sort of, you know, let's create something that can be on set physically, but then we will augment the heck out of it in post. And when we started seeing the suit come together and then when Mick, who played the creature, put the suit on, we saw the Sandman exactly the way we wanted it to be, physically. All of a sudden the CG became much less important and we were able to rely much more on having that physical creature, which again, a throwback to the great horror movies of the 80s where the villain is a man there physically on set, whether it's Jason or Michael or Freddie. These were real people that were on set with your victims and there's just no substitute. No, there really isn't. And Mick, actually, Mick Ignis, who plays the Sandman, has a lot of experience kind of being in makeup and performing in makeup. So that was good to have somebody who kind of knew his way around that world. And he's so wonderful. And he's such a fan as well. And as word of the film has spread and interest has grown, I mean, he gets more excited about all this than anybody. He just absolutely loved everything about what he does. And I think that translates onto the screen. Yeah, that's interesting. I think there's kind of like a movement kind of going on right now where talking to directors that have films that feature a creature or supernatural or otherwise, there's a movement to kind of do it more where there is a physical being on the set and then augmenting that with CGI. And, you know, obviously the movie It did that extremely well, how they combined both. And it seems to work the best. It was a creature. We're all CGI. We're kind of used to seeing it and we can kind of spot it these days. Oh, absolutely. So do you feel that's something that going forward you're going to be doing a lot more of? Yeah, it's been a process. It started before we did Crooked Man. Crooked Man, I directed a film called Ominous. And Ominous had a lot of sort of CG creature elements. There were birds and all sorts of things. And I felt that my favorite shots in the film were the ones that involved an actual man in a mask or creature makeup, which were done in that film by Vincent Quastini, another wonderful effects artist. So it's sort of learning from that experience when we went ahead to Crooked Man and we discussed what should the Crooked Man be a CG creation? You know, heavily advocated. No, this should be a, you know, we can do some stuff to, you know, maybe make them a little bit more crooked in post. But no, this should be a man in a suit. And it was, again, so wonderfully effective that when it came to this film, it's sort of been a growing process that we sort of, OK, we tried more of a CG route and more world. So now we're trying to back off as much as we can. And from an acting standpoint, it's a lot easier to act with somebody else on the set than essentially a tennis ball like happens a lot of times. It is, but it's also interesting because, you know, Mick is such a wonderful guy, even when he's wearing the suit, you just love him and he's so friendly. And so, I mean, we get some really funny pictures of him and the cat hanging out on set, you know, and there's one picture in particular that I have somewhere, you know, he's holding a teddy bear. It's just the funniest thing. Because, yes, but the converse of that is that you get used to Mick and you have to remember, oh, wait a minute, no, this is scary Mick now, not friendly teddy bear Mick. And how long was your shoot? The shoot was about a month. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. So you did a lot in very little time. Yeah, yeah, we did. And then what was the turnaround? How long did it take you to post this? We shot it in the spring, so I'd say a couple of months. I mean, we were very cognizant of the fact, I mean, look, even though we had this wonderful suit and we had the, you know, and Mick Mick and all of these sort of secret weapons, we still had almost about 200 effect shots in the film. Wow. CG. And so we were very cognizant when we were doing the schedule that we would need a couple of months for those teams to do the work. And I ended up being two teams working on it, get it all done in time. And Synaptic did all the fan man effects with me. It's such a great job. And once we finally sort of agreed on an approach and there was several different tests and we actually shot tests before we even filmed the film. Before we shot a frame of the movie, we had Mick put the suit on and we shot it and sent it over and said, OK, this is what it's going to look like. This is how we're going to light it. What can you do with knowing that? Probably three to four, maybe three months, you know, for post time. Let's take a break talking with Peter Sullivan of his film, The Sandman. You know, with these type movies and just watching the sneak peek and a little bit of the trailer, it just seems like the use of shadow and lighting is so important in these movies to really create that mood and that tension. I guess you had to work a little bit with your DP on that to kind of get the right look. Because if you show too much, obviously it's going to kill the mood, so to speak. Yeah, no, we did. Aton did a film for us earlier this year that I was not a director on. I was a writer and producer on it. It's a really cool kind of 80s biopic that will be on next year. And while we were working on that, we would talk about films that we really liked and we both really, really liked horror films. And so when this project came up, I called him and said, hey, is this something you'd be interested in? And he was extremely excited. I mean, I did a shot list, but we would literally go through every single scene shot by shot in the office ahead of time. Sometimes acting scenes out if necessary. Talking about, well, we could have the light come from over here and then the camera goes over there and really plan it out meticulously so that we made the best we could of the time and budget and everything. So when you sit down to write this, I guess it's pretty much they call writing the solitary profession. Is that, I guess, do you write like you can write on tablets now, even your phone, if you want to? Or do you primarily just kind of block time and just go at it? It depends on the project. I mean, I'll give you a funny example. So this particular film, Fan Man, I was working on the script while we were shooting this biopic earlier this year that I was producing. And so literally every day I would come to set with my iPad and I had gotten a keyboard attached to it. And I would literally go in every day and say, OK, which actor isn't showing up? So I can go into their trailer and work on the script for Fan Man. And so I would disappear for a couple hours every day just trying to steal any time I could to work on the script. And a lot of this was written on an iPad in a corner somewhere, just kind of doing what I can. It is different. I mean, the film that I just finished to rewrite for one of the Christmas movies, I mean, I would go into my office every day and work on it. And then if the crunch time, you start doing it at home as well, weekends, evenings, that kind of thing. And I think the more up against the deadline you are, the more you disappear from life. Hey, what happened to Peter? Where did he go? Well, that's multitasking, I'll tell you. You've got it down. It's amazing how you can kind of shift from project to project. And what am I directing today? I've got to say, I like it because the projects are so different from one another. I mean, I went from Fan Man. I mean, literally, I think we had wrapped the film a week and I was in pre-production on a Christmas film. And it's, I mean, so different. It's a family-oriented, romantic comedy, you know, also with a little girl. But in a very different way. And it allows you to kind of reset sometimes, like you don't get stuck in one sort of thing. It's like, okay, now I can put that away and I'm going to go into something completely different. And then when that's finished, I'm going to put that away and go into something, you know, completely different again. Is this going to see the light as a DVD eventually? It will. After the first of the year at some point, January, February, Lions Gate will be releasing it on video. And the video version has a couple of additional scenes in the end credits. So, I'm looking out for that. As a filmmaker, what do you think about, you know, before we wrap here, about the different platforms now that you can essentially get your films shown? And, you know, I think what's actually revolutionized it a lot is on demand and how a lot of films are available there that maybe wouldn't see a long extended theatrical release. I think it's fantastic because I've seen the evolution. When I first started in this business, you know, doing TV movies, you know, there were a lot more networks showing them. They were, you know, the budgets were very different. And I've sort of seen the ebb and flow. And I've seen, you know, the growth and storytelling in television where, you know, television has gone from something that was sort of avoided by, you know, there was sort of a divide between the feature world and the television world. And now I think some of the best stories are being told on television. And then, you know, that is now making its way into the, you know, the streaming world, you know, which was great shows on Netflix. I was on the last Christmas movie I did. You know, at night I would binge watch Handmaid's Tale. There you go. And that sort of thing. And now, you know, we just had the new Star Trek. That's right. Which I saw the first episode on PBS and went and signed up for the PBS All Access so I could see the second half. And I could tell that there was a definite decision to move away from sort of the episodic nature of the other Star Treks into something that's much more of a, you know, a giant movie. It looks that way. So, yeah, it does look that way. But, you know, we'll see. I enjoyed it. You know, it was I liked the characters a lot. You know, to have like two women front and center, I thought that was awesome. And a big fan of both of them. So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do. And I didn't know Spock had a quote unquote sister, but that's okay. The question is, does Spock know? Spock know, yeah. We'll never know. They can't merge those two universes the way they were doing it. Those two generations. But yeah, it is. It's a fantastic world right now. Do you worry like people may be seeing your films on their phone, for example? I mean, some filmmakers despise that because you lose the big screen experience. You know, at this point, I mean, we've talked about it. And I've never approached anything with that in mind. Like, oh, somebody might be watching this on the TV. So let me get a tighter shot or something like that. I know people that have. I feel that, you know, the more people that can see your phone, whether it's on a phone or an iPad or an iMac screen, you know, the better. I know that, you know, there are purists, Christopher Nolan, who very much want to see their phones on the big screen and the big screen possible. And, you know, perhaps if I was in his position, I would feel the same way. But, you know, I feel very fortunate to be doing what I'm doing and to have the opportunity that I do have. And so any time somebody watches one of my films, whether it's, you know, on a phone or a watch, I consider that a win."}, "podcast_summary": "In this podcast, director Peter Sullivan discusses his film \"The Sandman,\" which is a horror movie based on the legend of the Sandman.

The Sandman in the film is attached to this girl and comes from her nightmares. The design of the Sandman went through a couple of iterations, initially being much bulkier before becoming sleeker and more aerodynamic. The film features Tobin Bell, known for his role in the \"Saw\" franchise, and while Sullivan doesn't reveal if Bell's character is a good guy or villain, he does mention that the film plays with audience expectations. Sullivan also discusses the importance of the mother and daughter relationship in the film, stating that he wanted to create an interesting arc for the mother character who goes from being unprepared for motherhood to becoming a strong mother figure. The Sandman itself is a mix of prosthetics and CGI, but the decision was made to rely more on the physical creature rather than heavy CGI. Sullivan mentions that having a physical being on set makes it easier for the actors. The shoot for the film took approximately a month, and the post-production process took a couple of months due to the approximately 200 effect shots in the film. Sullivan highlights the importance of lighting and shadows to create mood and tension in horror films. He also discusses the different platforms available for filmmakers to get their films shown, such as on-demand and streaming services. Sullivan enjoys the growth of storytelling in television and streaming, and mentions binge-watching shows like \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Star Trek: Discovery.\" He doesn't worry too much about people watching his films on their phones because he believes that the more people that can see his films, the better. Overall, Sullivan is grateful for the opportunity to make films and considers it a win whenever someone watches one of his films, regardless of the platform.", "podcast_guest": "Peter Sullivan", "podcast_guest_org": "Sci-Fi Talk", "podcast_guest_title": null, "podcast_guest_info": "Not Available", "podcast_guest_url": null, "podcast_highlights": "\"we realized that that was not going to be effective, both from a production standpoint and also from a scare standpoint.
