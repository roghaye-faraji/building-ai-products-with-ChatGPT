I want to let you know about an event I'm hosting for Intelligence Squared on the 9th October in London. I'll be talking to Michael Lewis, the renowned author of best-selling books including Moneyball, The Big Short, Flash Boys and Liars Poker. We're going to be discussing his most anticipated work to date, Going Infinite, The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon. It's a gripping real-time narrative telling the story of Sam Bankman Freed who became the world's youngest billionaire before his 30th birthday and was behind one of the most catastrophic financial meltdowns of the 21st century. Lewis was granted unprecedented access to his subject allowing him to witness Bankman Freed's entire tumultuous journey. We'll learn all about this unconventional figure who nonchalantly wore cargo shorts and played video games while giving interviews but remained a mystery even to his investors. What gave him such an outstanding ability to make money and what led to the spectacular collapse of his empire? To hear the tale of an extraordinary individual and a 21st century epic encompassing high-frequency trading, insane amounts of money, hubris and downfall, join us at 7pm on the 9th October in London or online. Just visit intelligencesquared.com to find out more. Welcome to Intelligence Squared. I'm senior producer Connor Boyle. Coming up, Mark Gagliotti, the historian of Russia with a focus on areas such as politics, security and the murky backwaters of the Kremlin joins us to discuss Putin after pre-Goshen. With no further ado, let's jump into the conversation. Mark Gagliotti, if you're a keen listener to the podcast, you'll have heard him speak about his books, Putin's Wars, the weaponization of everything and many more times previous. He's a historian and he's the director of the cult, the sultancy group, Mayak Intelligence, and I'm delighted to say he joins me now. Hi, Mark. Thank you so much for coming on today. Oh, good to be back. Well, we've had a bit of distance now. It's been a number of weeks since this spectacular demise of pre-Goshen kind of going down in flames, quite literally. What do you make of that event now with a bit of distance? How significant was it? I mean, I think it was significant in the sense that it showed us quite a few of the underlying processes and pressures that are currently really not just shaping, but distorting, I would say, the Putin regime. The very fact that this mutiny could take place was really quite an indictment of Putin's leadership. For 23 years, after all, he's presided over a system which is really based on divide and rule. You know, you've got a modern, functional, almost Western-style bureaucratic state with an almost medieval court on top of it. And within that court, Putin keeps everyone competing against everyone else because basically that means that he retains his position as the pivotal decider. But a key element of that is that he and only he is meant to be monitoring these competitions and contests and stops them before they become dangerous and dysfunctional. And for months, people have been warning him that the rivalries between mercenary chief Prigozhin and Minister of Defense Shoigu was beginning to become dangerous. And I think because basically he shied away because he didn't have an easy resolution, he basically allowed this to reach a crisis point. So in some ways, I mean, he failed to manage this. This was really something that Putin should have nipped in the bud. And secondly, when it actually happened, we saw the security forces not so much joining the mutiny, but nor were they that eager to actually get involved to stop it. Which again is, if we think of this almost as a vote of confidence in Putin, the security forces largely abstained. And thirdly, and finally, the fact that Putin denounced Prigozhin as a traitor, then invited him and his field commanders to tea in the Kremlin, invited Prigozhin to Putin's big Africa summit in St. Petersburg, and seemed to have essentially made a deal. There was a formal pardon, after all, for Prigozhin and his men, and then killed him. Well, this is the first time I can think that Putin has actually broken his word with one of his own. He'll break international law quite easily. He will happily lie and deceive anyone else. But like any mafia gang, his regime depends on the idea that those people who are insiders, they know where they stand. And I think for Putin to flip-flop, I think again, is something else that has been taken as a sign that he's no longer anywhere near as in control that he was in the past. Well, after that initial mutiny, Putin seemed to try and calm everyone down and see things were normal. But he couldn't have let that go. He was plotting his own revenge. What about those loyal to Prigozhin or those in Wagner? For them, is the game up? Or do you think they could just be staying calm for now and plotting any sort of revenge or any future disruption to the Putin regime? We might see some disgruntled individual trying something, but the chances of getting through Putin's quite phenomenal extensive security is pretty minimal. I think generally speaking, what we're already seeing is that some Wagner fighters are essentially now signing on with the regular military or with other mercenary organizations because Wagner was not the only one. It was the biggest, but not the only one. Others are still active in Africa. We're still seeing an attempt to maintain its quite extensive operations there. Though again, whether that'll last for the long term is another matter. A few are probably taking the opportunity to head home. The point is, look, in this system, we shouldn't really assume that anyone is a true Putinist. Everyone is essentially out for themselves. When it comes down to it, yeah, there was a lot of personal support for Prigozhin who, in his own horrendous and thuggish way, did have a certain charisma and was able to get on with his fighters. They really do feel that Putin in effect let them down. What we're beginning to see is an increasing current of opinion within the ultra-nationalists, the people who usually would have been Putin's most ardent supporters. Increasingly, when they look at the incompetence and the amateurishness of the invasion of Ukraine, they're beginning to feel that it's actually patriotic to be anti-Putin, which is an interesting development. This is more a general trend rather than actually Wagner fighters. The mutiny was, after all, never about toppling Putin. It was about trying to change his mind, trying to get Putin to support Prigozhin. Over Shoigu. I think in the circumstances, essentially, people making all kinds of personal decisions, but it definitely has contributed to this sense that Putin is no longer the man Russian needs. Obviously, this political theater has been occurring on the upper echelons of Russian society, but do you have any sense of the stability of the economy or this sense of general public opinion? Is this just something which is almost taking place in remove of their daily lives, or is there a real sense of concern around these political events on the ground? It was interesting that when Prigozhin's troops rolled into Rostov-on-Don, which is the Russian city, which is basically the headquarters for the whole Ukraine war, they were essentially positively greeted. Then when they left after the resolution of the mutiny, there were crowds on the streets applauding, waving flags, taking selfies with the fighters and so forth, and particularly actually with Prigozhin himself. Now look, it's not actually as if this was about personal feelings towards a man who is, after all, a thuggish, if not murderer himself, but excuser of murder, people who had his people kill deserters with a sledgehammer to the head and such like. So it's not actually that they think, that Prigozhin, what a lovely chap. It's more that what they were expressing was an appreciation that someone was willing to stand up and tell it like it was. Prigozhin was there calling out the bureaucrats and the parade general, shall we say, in Moscow when he and his boys were actually doing the hard work and was calling out the lies that were coming from Moscow. So I think this is probably one of the reasons why I think Putin flip-flopped and decided Prigozhin was just too dangerous to be allowed to live. There is clearly a deep sense of dissatisfaction and concern within Russian society about what's going on. There's an interesting polling that although Putin's standing for election next year, and we know that essentially he will not only win, there you go, you heard it here first folks, but with whatever margin of victory the political technologists of the Kremlin decide they want to get. At the moment they're talking about 80 percent. But there was a recent and really sort of innovative series of polling which actually asked people if they had a totally free vote and they could vote for anyone for president, who would they vote for? And only 30 percent actually said Putin. I think it gives a sense, although there's no other serious rival at this stage, but that doesn't mean to say that they love Putin and they love what's going on. There is a lot of simmering discontent. The economy is not about to collapse, but yeah, it's beginning to feel the impact of war and sanctions. Russian GDP isn't doing too badly, gross domestic product, but if you take out the effect of the war economy and actually look just at the civilian economy, that really is suffering a lot more. People are dissatisfied, people are worried, people don't really know what's going on. But at present they don't really have the kind of flashpoint that is going to turn that into anything more organized. I mean at present I think most people are just kind of hunkered down. They're almost thinking of politics as being something like the weather. You can't change it, you can just endure it. And so I think that's the current situation. And Prigozhin was dangerous because he might actually try and tell people that maybe there could be some different route in their own way. And we'll have to see what happens with next year's elections, because elections are intrinsically destabilizing events. But at present, look, this system is increasingly brittle, but also still very strong. Hello, this is Jeremy Bowen, the International Editor of BBC News, and I'm here because I want to talk to you about an event I'm doing with Intelligence Squared on the 2nd of November in London. And I'm going to be talking about the more than 30 years that I've spent reporting on major events in the Middle East with my great friend and colleague over many, many years, Justin Webb. And I'm sure we'll talk about a few other things as well. Justin and I started at the BBC on the same day in 1984. So if you'd like to join us either in person or online, then visit intelligencesquared.com to find out more. It seems like both in terms of the war and in Russian politics, we're on a bit of a lull period after some very dramatic events in the months prior. I just wonder what your thoughts are on Putin's mentality. If we go all the way back to the article he wrote before the invasion of Ukraine on the historic connections between Russia and Kiev, how do you think he feels about how things have gone now with some more time to maybe think about it past the drama of a pro-Gosian rival, past the thought, in the attritional phase of the war? Do you think he's still in the sense of, I'm going to win, I'm hyper motivated, or do you think he might start asking, is it really worth it? Crawling into the deep dark recesses of Putin's brain is never a particularly useful little unpleasant experience. I'm here, I'm essentially clearly having to speculate. There's no way he cannot be aware of how badly things are going to some degree. We also know that he's surrounded by cronies and yes men. He's insulated from a lot of the bad news. If one looks at that quite ridiculous and historically bankrupt article that he wrote about why Ukraine is not really a country and so forth, there will be many, many people around him. For example, his foreign intelligence chief is actually basically an amateur historian of some note. There are people who know that it's nonsense, but the point is this is not a system in which anyone can go and say, Vladimir, Vladimirovich, you know you've got that wrong. Nonetheless, he will be getting the casualty figures. He will be getting the updated maps for who controls what. So he must have some sense of where things are. The thing is what we don't really know, and what I suspect is going to be crucial is how far he is able to in effect convince himself that happier times are just over the horizon. His current rhetorical position is the reason why things haven't gone so well in Ukraine is not actually because of the heroism of the Ukrainian people and their determination to resist. It's because essentially Russia is now up against the whole of the West, NATO and its friends. Ukraine is in some ways just the battlefield for what is now essentially a global conflict. In that respect, I think he can kid himself that even just to hold the line for a country with a GDP the size of Spain is pretty damn impressive. And I think he's also convincing himself that just over the horizon, Western unity and determination to continue to support Ukraine is going to start fracturing, whether it's because of a Trump victory in America or whatever else. So, you know, I suspect that although on one level he must be concerned and he must know that his initial expectations of Ukraine have been proven totally wrong. I think he's kind of found himself get out clauses that allow him to justify his mistake. It wasn't that he got Ukraine wrong, it's that the West intervened and still gives him grounds for hope. If he can just hold on another few weeks, months, maybe a year or two and things will suddenly get better, that would be my guess. Will Barron One question which has cropped up recently is Ukraine potentially using Western weapons to hit inside Russian territory. And that bolsters Putin's ability to say, listen, this is Russia versus the West and say that around the world. Do you worry about that? Is that something we should be concerned about, actual strikes inside Russian territory with Western weapons? Do you think that's just an inevitability or is this something which we should be concerned about? Will Barron I mean, I think it is worrying because of two reasons, both really related to Putin's capacity to escalate. Look, he talks a lot every now and then, hinting at the use of tactical nuclear weapons. I think that's very, very unlikely for all kinds of reasons, not least the fact that the Chinese pretty much read him the riot act on that one. However, he does have other ways of escalating. One of the things that in fact I thought we would face, but we haven't yet, are Russian covert operations inside Europe to try and disrupt the supply lines bringing in weapons. I mean, back in 2014, for example, there was an explosion in a Czech ammunition dump at a place called Vrb\u011btice, which turned out to be a Russian military intelligence operation to prevent a supply of ammunition that was going to be supplied to Ukraine from ever getting there. We haven't had more Vrb\u011btice's and I think in part, that's precisely because Putin himself is very eager not to provoke NATO. He's very, very clear that he understands that that will be a totally impossible challenge. But nonetheless, if he absolutely feels that his backing is against the wall and if he thinks precisely that NATO is now essentially arming a war of invasion against Russia, he may be tempted to do that. But more to the point, look, at the moment he's holding back from further mass mobilizations, even though that's what his generals would want, because he's aware that it'"}, "podcast_summary": "The podcast discusses two main topics: the rise and fall of a new tycoon named Sam Bankman Freed, and the current state of Russian politics under Putin.
